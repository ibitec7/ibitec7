👋 Hi, I’m @ibitec7

- 👀 I am captivated by the field Data Science, Artificial Intelligence. I have a keen interest in understanding how Machine Learning Algorithms work and are built. I also have an interest in exploring any data and trying to unravel what it is trying to communicate.

- 🌱 I have completed my Data Science certifications from DataCamp and I am a certified Data Analyst Associate, Data Engineer and Data Scientist Professional. I am currently a freshman in the BS Data Science program. I have a strong background in Mathematics and Statistics as well. I have studied Math and Further Math courses in my A-Levels. Along with that I have studied some fundamental courses to Machine Learning like Linear Algebra, Multi-Variable Calculus, Calculus 2 etc. on my own initiative through bootcamps. Along with that some essential statistics courses related to sampling, Hypothesis testing, Distributions, theoretical statistics etc.
I demontrate proficiency in 5 programming languages namely: Python, SQL, Rust, C/C++, and R.

- 🤝 I’m looking forward to collaborating on Data Science projects like Exploratory Analysis, Data Cleaning/Wrangling, Data Visualization, Machine/Deep Learning (with Pytorch and sklearn). However, I'm not limited to just data science collaboration but also generally collaborating on any project related to C/C++ or Rust as well. Feel free to contact me for any collaboration, joint project venture or assistance related to what I have mentioned.
